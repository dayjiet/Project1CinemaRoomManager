## Description

This project is a Java application that allows you to manage a cinema theatre. It provides various functionalities such as selling tickets, checking available seats, and displaying sales statistics. By working on this project, you will have the opportunity to enhance your skills in handling input and output in Java, working with arrays and functions, as well as using loops and conditional statements effectively.

## Features
The Cinema Room Manager application offers the following features:

- Show the seats: This option displays the current seating arrangement in the cinema room. It iterates through a 2D array representing the seating grid and prints each row, showing the availability of seats.
- Buy a ticket: Users can purchase a ticket for a specific seat in the cinema room. The application prompts the user to enter the row and seat numbers, checks the validity of the input, calculates the ticket price based on the seating rules, updates the seating grid, and provides the cost of the ticket.
- Statistics: This feature allows users to view various statistics of the cinema room. It displays the number of purchased tickets, the percentage of occupancy, the current income, and the total income potential.
- Exit: Users can choose to exit the application.

## Usage
To use the Cinema Room Manager application, follow these steps:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of rows in the cinema room.
3. Enter the number of seats in each row.
4. Use the menu options to perform different actions:
   - Enter 1 to show the seats.
   - Enter 2 to buy a ticket.
   - Enter 3 to view statistics.
   - Enter 0 to exit the application.

The application will continue to display the menu after each action until the user chooses to exit.

## Feedback
During the Cinema Room Manager project, I gained valuable insights into working with input and output in Java. This project provided me with an opportunity to utilize arrays, functions, loops, and conditional statements effectively.

One of the main challenges I encountered was organizing and managing the seating arrangement in the cinema. I overcame this challenge by utilizing a 2D array to represent the seats and implementing logic to display the current state of the seating arrangement, sell tickets, and calculate statistics.

Additionally, I learned the importance of user input validation to ensure the correctness and integrity of the application. I incorporated checks to handle invalid inputs, such as seat numbers and row numbers that exceed the available seats.

Overall, this project enhanced my understanding of Java programming and allowed me to apply various concepts in a practical scenario. It improved my skills in handling input and output, working with arrays, and implementing control structures. Through this project, I developed a deeper appreciation for the complexities involved in managing a cinema theatre and gained valuable experience in creating a functional cinema room management application.
